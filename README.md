## To use, 
1 - Clone / download this repository<br>
2 - install the required modules (run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`)<br>
2 - Put your desired \_tex.sc files in the same directory as main.py<br>
3 - And finally run main.py with python.<br>

## Required modules

## To-do list
- Compression on csv (output files are huge)
